## Problem Statement
To propose a sandwich model to detect small objects within SAR images by performing comprehensive research analysis, observing the intuition and the shortfalls of the existing methods to optimize the performance through the Feature Refinement Module.

## Solution
After extensive research and study, we determined that `tood_r50_fpn_1x_SSDD` to perform the best. This application leverages the model for small image detection.
